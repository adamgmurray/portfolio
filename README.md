This[https://adamgmurray.github.io/portfolio/] is my personal website [www.adamgmurray.xyz] .
I am working on this while taking help desk phone calls in Cleveland, Ohio. 
I asked the boss- they're cool with it.
It contains every employement-related-tid-bit about me. 
*spoiler-alert*
I'm intending to land my first job as a front-end developer in early 2017. Hit me up! adam@adamgmurray.xyz
