This is my personal website which I am working on while doing help desk support in Cleveland Ohio. 
(I asked my boss, they're cool with it as long as it isnt my primary effort on the clock.)
It contains everything employement related about me: work experience, updated resume, freeCodeCamp projects, and personal projects. 
Want to hire me into a junior front-end development role? Hit me up! adam@adamgmurray.xyz
